# Deep Sentiment NLP

A collection of deep learning–based sentiment analysis and aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) models built using modern NLP techniques.

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains notebooks exploring different approaches to sentiment analysis, with a focus on **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)**.  
All models are implemented in Python and trained on publicly available datasets.

## 🧠 Models & Approaches
### Sentiment Analysis 
* BiLSTM Model: A deep learning-based recurrent neural network (RNN) approach for capturing sequential patterns in text.
* Artificial Neural Network (ANN): A simple feedforward neural network with fully connected layers.
* Logistic Regression: A traditional linear classifier for binary/multiclass classification.
* Support Vector Machine (SVM): A robust classifier that maximizes the margin between classes.  

**Pre-trained GloVe embeddings are used to represent text data as dense vectors.**

### Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)
- **LSTM + Aspect Embeddings (AE)**
- **LSTM + Attention**
- **Attention + LSTM + Aspect Embeddings**
- **ABSA with External Knowledge**
  - Incorporates external semantic knowledge to enhance aspect-level sentiment understanding

## ⚙️ Techniques Used
- Attention mechanisms
- Aspect embeddings
- External knowledge integration
- Deep learning with PyTorch / TensorFlow

## 📊 Datasets
- Publicly available sentiment and ABSA datasets (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/charitarth/semeval-2014-task-4-aspectbasedsentimentanalysis)

## 🚀 Purpose
This repository serves as:
- A learning and experimentation space for NLP models
- A reference for implementing ABSA using deep learning
